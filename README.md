# TaxiApp

Description:<br/>
Taxi application for the iOS platform, developed in SwiftUI. You can order a taxi based on your Location(GeoFire and Firebase) without creating an account. While you can create an account to be a taxi driver<br/>

Why I have built this project:<br/>
I created this project to learn more about reproducing some UI Designs and how to handle the communication between apps.<br/>

Download (all commands are marked with ' '):<br/>
1. Download it via Github and open the TaxiApp.xcworkspace file in Xcode.
2. Change the bundle Identifier to the desired name for both targets and make sure to select a developer account.
3. Create a Firebase Project on https://console.firebase.google.com without Analytics. Create two apps for both targets with Firestore and add those .plist files to both targets
4. Install all packages via cocoapods in the terminal while using the 'pod install' command
5. Now run the app in XCode

Things to improve: <br/>
There are many things to improve, but due to a big pause in development caused by not having time because I had to study for school, I decided not to continue this project.
